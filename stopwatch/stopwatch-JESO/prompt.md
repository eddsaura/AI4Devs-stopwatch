Using ChatGPT

## First iteration

You are a professional web developer.

You have to develop a web with two functionalities.

- A stopwatch
- A countdown

For the creation of this project I want you to use your expertise in HTML and Javascript.

Make sure to use fundamentals of clean code, and make code maintainable.

We should have a landing where you can select to open the stopwatch or the countdown.
Then, each functionality will have its own space.

You can do 3 HTMLS, one for the landing, and one for each function. 

Keep common code in one Javascript file, if you need something different you can split it based on good practices.

## The stopwatch
- It should have an start button.
- When its running the start button will be a stop.
- If there is time in the stopwatch you can click again to continue.
- There  should be a stop button


## The countdown
- It should have an input to enter the time where to start.
- It should have an start button.
- It should have an stop button if the time is counting.
- It should have a clear button.

Before doing code, make sure you understood everything, ASK ME WHATEVER YOU DON'T KNOW.



## Confirm, refine and pass the image
Yes, but in the countdown make the same with the start and stop button as the stopwatch. It turns into a stop when it's running.

Aslo, Make it look like the attached image.

Make sure the rest is modern and spacious design.


## Confirm after its confirmation

Yes please proceed



*** outputs code ***

## Fix one thing

The countdown is not working. The input is to mark from where do we start counting down.

Maybe you can do an input for hours, an input for minutes and an input for seconds.

Then add a "SET COUNTDOWN" button.

An then as it is, with start, stop in the same button and the clear.

What do you think?

And it works!
